## [Wireless attack protection, other,..]

  <strong>any readers with knowledge and awareness of this goal already being acheived within existing technologies, please tell me! that is why i have shared my ~scratch~pad</strong> 

category: vulnerability scanning and attack prevention (ips)<br>
specificity: "eavesdropping & related wireless attacks"<br>
purpose: to avoid single point of failure in vs/ips<br>
expanded:<br>

*<p>if there is failure of an attack prevention service at host level it can be assumed that clustering technology will allow for an alternate instance of the
    service to coninue operating. what if the prevention system failed entirely across all new instances. would there be any potential improvement by isolating         various prevention services (ie:attacks on IoT smart assistants, listening attacks on any internet device with listening capable hardware/software, data             harvesting attacks, etc..)</p>*
  
  caveats:
  - is this goal already acheived somehow in the services architecture (have not looked in detail on these scanning & prevention solutions recently)
  - if a future state becomes many separate services completing specific tasks, will resource effeciency be maintained in the process?

### pre-requisite

if aimed with specificity (home IoT devices for instance) it would require these home users/networks to implement scanning & prevention solutions. this is covered by my underlying project arguing for isp provided base security. in my ms final project i aim to suggest the practicality for isp's in partnership with open source security groups and government to deliver a reasonable baseline monitoring/alerting/prevention package included with all levels of internet service. paying for internet is a weak structure given our societial wealth distribution issues. as technology advances (especially in the open source ecosystem) we must not allow basic home security to come with such a price tag. 

parallel to home IoT devices finding usefulness in the tool i also imagine usefulness in wireless vehicle networks or related critical wireless networks utilizing many wireless sensors. the reason is the tool would be developed for optimizing resource and effeciency so as to remain stable and rapidly successful in detection or protection against wireless channel attacks.

## [Intelligent Street-Sweeping Robots...]

I was thinking we should be close enough to developing and deploying robots to pick up litter. The idea sparked as I saw someone picking up trash on the side of the road during a bike ride. Often it seems this is done by juvenile deliquents or similar groups of individuals. I was imaging the possibility for robots to complete this task and the individuals traditionally completing this work would be re-skilled in maintenance of such robots. This would add to the individuals value in joining a future workforce that is engulfed in AI and robotics, generally. Furthermore, the robots could have enough vision capability (360 cameras, etc) to collect environmental variables that will be sent out to a central intelligence, my idea was a quantum ML supercomputer. This central intelligence would be analyzing the environmental data collected so as to determine potential improvements in infrastructure, transportation, and related topics for improved effeciency as well as more harmonious integration methods with the natural world.
